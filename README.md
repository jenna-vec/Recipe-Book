# Recipe Books 

### [visit live site](https://recipesbooks.net/)


This project is created with Firebase authentication, Firestore Database, and React. It is styled using [MUI library](https://mui.com/).
Users can create an account with their email, then write/update/delete recipes in their private recipe book. 

**Rules:**
Firebase security rules allow data, such as user email, to remain private. 
Only authenticated users can access their account's data and perform CRUD operations for their recipes.
